# Andrew Pepin's Project 1
For this project, I made two applications for analyzing datasets obtained from: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/memetracker9.html

WordTrender plots out the number of instances containing a specified word over time.

CommonPhrases prints how many times a 2-word or 3-word phrase occurs in the dataset.
